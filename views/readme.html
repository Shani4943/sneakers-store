    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing security measures, specifically for preventing DOS attacks, proved difficult. At one point, downloading a folder disrupted the logic and functionality of the entire site</li>
        <li>I dedicated a lot of effort to designing the pages. My goal was to create layouts that catered to the unique needs of each page while maintaining a consistent design across the entire site. Balancing these two aspects was particularly challenging</li>

    <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing and ensuring all tests worked as expected was challenging, particularly with the test for adding a product to the cart. Each time I attempted to add an item, the application redirected me to the login page, causing significant issues.</li>
        <li>Dividing the routing logic into multiple pages was a complex task. Initially, we had a single centralized routing page, and splitting it into different pages led to various issues and inconsistencies in the application.</li>
