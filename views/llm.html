    <h1>LLM Generated Code</h1>
    <p>
    In developing our project, we primarily utilized ChatGPT as a collaborative tool, guiding us through different steps of the process. 
    We engaged with ChatGPT by asking questions, seeking clarifications, 
    and requesting specific pieces of code that were then integrated into our project. 
    This approach allowed us to work alongside ChatGPT, creating the application in a step-by-step manner.
    The key pages where we utilized ChatGPT's help include:

    <ul>
    <li>controllers/userController.js</li>
    <li>public/main.css</li>
    <li>public/other.css</li>
    <li>public/store.css</li>
    <li>routes/userRoutes.js</li>
    <li>views/admin.ejs</li>
    <li>views/cart.ejs</li>
    <li>views/checkout.ejs</li>
